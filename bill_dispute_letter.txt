Re: Formal Dispute of Patient Balance
Patient: Michael Donovan
Date of Birth: February 22, 1968
Account Number: RM-2024-047291
Claim Number: CLM-2024-8812047
Statement Date: September 20, 2024

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to formally dispute the balance listed on the above-referenced medical bill. I am requesting that Riverside Medical Center place this account on hold and suspend collection activity until the billing issues below are fully reviewed and corrected.

My Explanation of Benefits from UnitedHealthcare does not match the billing statement I received from your office. The EOB reflects billed charges of $4,650.00, while my patient statement shows $4,000.00. I am requesting a complete itemized bill showing every charge submitted to my insurer, including any charges that do not appear on the current patient statement, and a written explanation for this discrepancy.

In addition, the EOB indicates that the emergency department facility fee remains under review for medical necessity. Because that review is still open, the patient responsibility amount is not final. I dispute any attempt to collect the disputed portion of the balance before the insurer completes its review and a corrected determination is issued.

Please provide the following in writing:

1. A full itemized bill for this encounter.
2. An explanation for the difference between the provider statement total and the amount billed on the EOB.
3. Confirmation that the account has been placed on hold pending resolution of the insurer review.
4. A corrected balance statement after the review is complete.

Until this matter is resolved, I request that you do not treat this balance as final, do not send the account to collections, and do not demand payment on the disputed portion.

Please respond in writing within 30 days.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
